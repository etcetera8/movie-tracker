### Project Specs

The user is shown a home page upon first visitation which is populated with the most recent movies showing in theaters through imdtb's api. The user has the ability to favorite movies and have these be stored in the backend to persist on logout and returning to the website. The user has the ability to see all of their favorites by clicking on the favorites tab. More information from the movie is provided on a hover state over the poster. The app is fully tested with Jest/Enzyme.

We completed this project in a one week sprint.
